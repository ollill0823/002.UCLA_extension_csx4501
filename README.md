Hi, everyone.

I am here to study data science with you and I am welcome to provide any help, if you have any questions, please do not hesitate to ask me, thank you. 


## Autobiography:
This is **Chen Wang**, came from Taiwan and was a semiconductor engineer in TSMC. I decide to change my area to data science, and I hope it can develop me and guide me to achieve success in the USA.


## courses insight:

* ***Learn basic statistics:*** I should be proficient in any statistics related, including basic statistics methods ( my previous job used linear regression to built-up my model, but I want more
* ***Python programming fundamental:*** it's a long way to go. But to be or not to be, depends on my mindset.
* ***Data visualization:*** execute model from excel to Jupyter or python.
* ***Setup my investigation background in the sports area:*** The final project I need to consider is if I can process my sports research.
